            <h2>My Reflection</h2>
        <p>     On my journey to learn web development, I faced many challenges. The biggest issue I
            faced was learning how to format the site and put text and images in the spot where I
            wanted them. Another big issue was having big ideas for the website but not knowing how
            to do them. The word press method was a little easier to put information into, however,
            it was very confusing with so many different options to click. I think it is very good
            for making something quick that looks decent. On the other hand, I prefer the coding
            option over WordPress because it gives you more freedom and is easier to understand. The
            challenges of formatting were not knowing how to move certain objects and having to
            search for how to do it. For example, you would have to search for how to code it. On
            the WordPress site, you had to search through a bunch of menus to find what you were
            looking at. I would get lost in the menus and was very confused. The skills necessary to
            do both websites you still need to know some HTML and CSS to adjust the information to
            your liking. Some skills I want to improve are formatting images to make my website look
            better instead of just throwing images on the screen. Another skill would be my use of
            color and making an overall theme for the website. The colors I used I was testing out
            different things on the website.<br />
