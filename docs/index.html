        <p>The dog ate all the pizza. This is a body paragraph with some
                <strong>bold</strong> code to feature some text. Here is <a
                href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend">a link to an external
            website</a>.</p>
        <p>A useful tool to learning html is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. 
            Here is a reference for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes you can use for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Below are examples of block elements!!!</h2>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>putting q tage puts it in quotes</q>. It makes a bulleted list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pizza</li>
            <li>icecream</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>juice</li>
            <li>burger</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. 
            You have to see the difference by viewing in a web browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>one</li>
            <li>two</li>
            <li>three</li>
            <li>four</li>
            <li>five</li>
