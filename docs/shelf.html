        <p>The Libary Shelf I chose to research on was the world facts shelf. Here is a link to the csv <a href= "https://github.com/EvanB6/portfolio/blob/main/World%20Facts%20Digit%20Library%20Shelf%20-%20World%20Facts%20Digit%20Library%20Shelf.csv">file</a>
            <br></br>
            The <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/5921819/world_facts_digit_library_shelf/library">Zotero</a> group is where I collected all my sources for the data.
