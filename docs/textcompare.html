        <p> I am exploring fiction in the 2000s and news in the 2000s and how their word choice is
            similar and different. </p>

        <p class="center"> The commonly used N-Grams in Fiction during the 2000s were <strong>of
                the, in the, to the, on the, and the, it was, and at the</strong>. Additonally, the
            commonly used news N-Grams were <strong>of the, in the, to the, and the</strong>,and
                <strong>for the</strong>. Both works of texts fiction and news used <strong>of the,
                in the, and to the</strong>. These were the most common similarites between the two.
            Also, I noticed the phrase <strong>it was</strong> was used alot in fiction, but did not
            show up in the news. </p>

        </div>
        <p class="center"> The word <strong>said</strong> is very common between the two types of
            text. I believe this is mostly from characters talking and the news saying who said
            what. The words like <strong>captain</strong> and <strong>dial</strong> are specific to
            the fiction texts and it makes sense why it does not show up in the text. The name
            captain dial shows up many times in the selected fiction texts. He seems to be a main
            character in these texts. The words like pages, government, police, american, and report
            are specfic to the new's texts. These words are common because they talk about problems
            throughout the world. For example the word <strong>report</strong> could be a news
            report on something along with the <strong>government</strong>. The word
                <strong>pages</strong> could indicate a source that the news is citing in it claims. </p>

        </div>
        <br />
        <p class="center">The word "of the" in the news and fiction is one of the top N-Grams with a
            size of 2. The use of <strong>of the</strong> in fiction is followed by the words
                <strong>other, people, white, family, state, hill, old, sea, and new</strong>. The
            use of <strong>of the</strong> in the news is commonly followed by <strong>city,
                American, biggest, late, class, day, first, elders, Norcross, past, and
                lowest</strong>. Notice the words in fiction that follow <strong>of the</strong> is
            mainly followed by a descriptive word like the "white sand" and "family business". Also,
            the words in fiction that come after <strong>of the</strong> are words like "biggest",
            "American", "lowest", and "city". These words are less descriptive words and more like
            news titles, or attention grabbers, of new like the "biggest" and "lowest".</p>

        <p class="center">The common N-Grams of size 3 in both texts are <strong>don't, did'nt, and
                other simple word phraes</strong>. The words<strong> fraser outermost ring</strong>,
                <strong>captain dial</strong>, and <strong>the old man</strong> are all fiction
            specfic words. I beleive these words to be specific to the story. However, in the new's
            text words like <strong>its a, its not,</strong> and <strong>its the</strong> show up a
            lot in the news, but barely shows up in the fiction text. I wonder why it shows up more
            in the news.</p>
