        <p> I am exploring fiction in the 2000s and news in the 2000s and how their word choice is
            similar and different. </p>

        <p class="center"> The commonly used N-Grams in Fiction during the 2000s were <strong>of
                the, in the, to the, on the, and the, it was, and at the</strong>. Additonally, the
            commonly used news N-Grams were <strong>of the, in the, to the, and the</strong>,and
                <strong>for the</strong>. Both works of texts fiction and news used <strong>of the,
                in the, and to the</strong>. These were the most common similarites between the two.
            Also, I noticed the phrase <strong>it was</strong> was used alot in fiction, but did not
            show up in the news. </p>

            </figure>
        </div>
        <p class="center"> The word <strong>said</strong> is very common between the two types of
            text. I believe this is mostly from characters talking and the news saying who said
            what. The words like <strong>captain</strong> and <strong>dial</strong> are specific to
            the fiction texts and it makes sense why it does not show up in the text. The name
            captain dial shows up many times in the selected fiction texts. He seems to be a main
            character in these texts. The words like pages, government, police, american, and report
            are specfic to the new's texts. These words are common because they talk about problems
            throughout the world. For example the word <strong>report</strong> could be a news
            report on something along with the <strong>government</strong>. The word
                <strong>pages</strong> could indicate a source that the news is citing in it claims. </p>
