        <p>Notes: The graphics of the are fairly simple, but pleasing to the eyes. 
       <br></br>Objects: you can pick up a watering bucket and fill it up at a water well to grow a plant. a stick that drags around in the sand. A basket. A bucket for milking the goat and for use in making goat cheese. A chicken coop that you open and close the doors. A merchant comes by everyday that drops off a letter from her brother and sells hay and goats.
        <br></br>Music: The music at the start is peacefeul and calm at the start with the birds chirping. Evenutally the music turns dark and sad as something comes and slowly destroys the farm. Eventually the music just stops and all life on the farm is gone.
