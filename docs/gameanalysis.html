                <ul>
                    <li> The main character you play as is a woman named Tikvah. You move around
                        with a simple point and click. You learn about the world through letters you
                        receive from your Tikvah's brother. The letters are received every day from
                        a merchant in-game. The letters are the main story telling device in the
                        game. You learn about the outside world and of the threats that are coming
                        to the farm.</li>

                    <li>The graphics of the are fairly simple, but pleasing to the eyes. There is
                        only one world that you can explore, but over time the farm your on slowly
                        changes. </li>

                    <li>The challenges of the game are to live on your farm, collect letters from
                        the merchant and do want ever you want on the farm. The game has very little
                        challenges are obstacles, however you have to get the letters each day from
                        the merchant to progress. The main objective is just to collect the letters
                        each day until you reach the end.</li>

                    <li> Music: The music is peacefeul and calm at the start with the birds
                        chirping. Evenutally the music turns dark and sad as something comes and
                        slowly destroys the farm. The crows in the image of a sign of death that
                        takes over the farm. Eventually the music just stops and all life on the
                        farm is gone. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>There are several objects that you can interact with while you play the
                        game. You can pick up a watering bucket and fill it up at a water well to
                        grow a plant. a stick that drags around in the sand. A basket. A bucket for
                        milking the goat and for use in making goat cheese. A chicken coop that you
                        open and close the doors. A merchant comes by everyday that drops off a
                        letter from her brother and sells hay and goats. The network on the right
                        shows what the player can interact with.</li>
                    <li>In conclusion, I chose to talk about this game because at first it appeared
                        to be interesting. While I was playing I enjoyed the calm atmosphere and
                        reading the letters to learn about the world. However, I began to become
                        bored after realizing the main point of the game was just to read the
                        letters to progress through the game. After realizing that all the other
                        things you can interact with and do were just there to spend your time
                        waiting for the merchant left me discouraged and lost the motivation to keep
                        playing. </li>
